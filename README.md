Some triforce in the universe
=============================

The Triforce project has the aim to show the (current) incompatibilities when compiling Pascal sources for the targets Amiga, AROS and MorphOS.

The current emphasis is focused on examples using the (common) native API of these targets, but isn't restricted to these terms.

The aim of this project is to pinpoint incompatibilities so that these can be fixed (see unit trinity for that), with the goal to be able to let this project die as soon as possible.

In the meantime, interested parties can use (and are allowed) to use any of the given solutions/examples/tutorials and other material presented herein, with the exception of material that is copyrighted by their respective owners (will be noted explicitly).

The examples/tutorials/publications are not really part of Triforce/Trinity, but allows to reveal/notice the incompatibilities. I do note again that most of these examples are copyrighted by their respective owners (as noted in their sources).

If you are new to the Amiga, AROS and/or MorphOS targets, then please feel free to use any of the presented material to help you learn how to program these platforms (using their native API), and don't hesitate to give some feedback and/or correct or point out mistakes.
