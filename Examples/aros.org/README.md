FPC Sources for AROS' examples

These examples were originally written in c by The AROS Development Team and are available [here](http://www.aros.org/documentation/developers/samples.php).

Here you can find those examples, rewritten for Free Pascal and compilable
for Amiga, AROS and MorphOS (using [Trinity](https://github.com/magorium/fpc-triforce/tree/master/Base/Trinity)).
